Version 0.7.0 (next release)
* excel reformatting for ranges (e.g. 1-6 now 1-to-6)
* checkv end_to_end: fixed bug when using --restart
* checkv repeats: check for zero length seqs when estimating copy number

Version 0.6.0 (current release)
* Bug fix in completeness module that suppressed HMM-based results
* HMM-based completeness now reported as range: 90% confidence interval = X-Y% complete
* Warnings added to quality_summary.tsv for range of conditions
* ?? Change from DIAMOND v0.9.30 to v0.9.32 to support OSX
* Minor parameter change for genome copy number estimation
* Terminal repeat sequence included in output file (e.g. GCACTTC...)
* Added terminal repeat metadata: ambig_freq and max_base_freq
* Dropped automated filtering of terminal repeats: up to user to decide how to handle flagged seqs
* Quality summary reports multiple types of termini when present (e.g. DTR & ITR on same contig)
* cleaned_contigs.fna split into viruses.fna and proviruses.fna
* Renamed field 'prophage' to 'provirus' in quality_summary.tsv

Version 0.5.1 (May 11, 2020)
* Added download_database module to automatically download latest version of db
* Added update_database module to update db with new genomes
* Added end_to_end module to run all CheckV modules
* Added documentation for output files in README
* Help text reformatted

Version 0.4.0 (May 6, 2020)
* New HMM-based completeness estimation
* New estimation of genome copy #
* Completeness capped at 100% in quality_summary.tsv output
* Dropped 'comments' field in quality_summary.tsv output
* Computation of aligned fraction fixed
* terminal_repeats module renamed to repeats (to accomonate repeat based estimation of genome copy #)
* All TRs now reported in repeats.tsv
* New field 'repeat_flagged' which indicates low complexity/repetetive repeats
* Added RELEASE_NOTES.txt file
* CheckV print program and database versions
* CheckV checks for input files in quality_summary module

Version 0.3.0 (April 27, 2020)
* Added documentation to README.md
